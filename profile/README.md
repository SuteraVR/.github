# Design

- World, avatar, client format, etc.
- Create an API . For example, add on to functions such as cameras, etc., or link worlds to external functions.
- Complete data processing within the sandbox environment. Prevent viruses and malicious scripts from executing and influencing the outside world.
- Allow users to set permissions for uploading, etc. Limited publication of worlds, etc.
